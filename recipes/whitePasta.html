    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>200g pasta (penne or fettuccine)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>
        Optional: garlic powder, Italian seasoning, or chopped parsley for extra
        flavor
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in
        the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth paste
        (roux).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to
        cook and whisk until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese
        until melted and well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        You can also add garlic powder, Italian seasoning, or chopped parsley
        for extra flavor if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the cooked pasta in the white sauce until well coated. Serve
        immediately and enjoy!
