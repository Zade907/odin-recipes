    <p>
      Chicken Lasagna is a delicacy that combines tender chicken, creamy cheese,
      and savory tomato sauce layered between sheets of pasta. This dish is a
      comforting and hearty meal that is perfect for family dinners or special
      occasions. The lasagna is typically made by layering cooked lasagna
      noodles with a mixture of seasoned ground chicken, ricotta cheese,
      mozzarella cheese, and marinara sauce. It is then baked until the cheese
      is melted and bubbly, creating a deliciously satisfying dish that is sure
      to please everyone at the table.
